# Potential Projects
A List of projects that I'm currently working on or interested in working.

- [eth1.0-specs](https://github.com/quilt/eth1.0-specs): I'm currently working on this project. I'm very much interested in understanding the inner workings of the EVM. Working on this project helps me meet that goal. Also, providing an executable spec over the YP to the community is something that I consider worth working on. 

- [Trin](https://github.com/carver/trin): Trin is an Ethereum "portal": a json-rpc server with nearly instant sync, and low CPU & storage usage. Providing the Ethereum community with a replacement for Infura is something I highly desire.

- [Fe](https://github.com/ethereum/Fe): Fe is a statically typed language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Having an alternative to solidity which is simple to build upon is very much needed.
