# Reading Resources
A collection of useful resources that I plan to constantly update as I read.

- [Yellow Paper Fontier Version](https://github.com/quilt/eth1.0-specs/blob/pyspec/yellowpapers/frontier.pdf): In order to understand the YP from a historical standpoint, starting from the first version(Frontier) is a great resource to begin with. Also, I'm currently working with the quilt team to replace the YP with an [executable spec](https://github.com/quilt/eth1.0-specs). They decided to start with the frontier version.

- [Py-EVM](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm): IMO, this repo has the most readable implementation of the EVM IMO. I use this repo as a reference to understand the YP.
